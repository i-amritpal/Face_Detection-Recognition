# Face_Detection
Face discovery should be possible utilizing Python and OpenCV library. I have utilized an outpouring classifier in this program, which can be stacked with a preprepared xml document. OpenCV as of now have these pre-prepared classifiers
prepared for face recognition. Calculation of face recognition is as per the following:
<br>

<b>Step (1)</b> Characterize the gadget used to catch the pictures.<br>
<b>Step (2)</b> Convert the pictures caught into greyscale pictures.<br>
<b>Step (3)</b> Utilize the face recognition classifier to recognize the countenances.<br>
<b>Step (4)</b> Show the result on the PC/PC screen.<br>
